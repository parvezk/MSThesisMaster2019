\begin{acknowledgments} 

This work would not have been realized without the help and support of the following people who graciously contributed to the work presented in this thesis.

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Gene Kogan for the continuous support of my thesis study and research, for his patience, motivation, immense knowledge and expertise. His counsel and guidance helped me throughout the research process and writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having a better mentor and advisor for my thesis study.

Besides my advisor, I also would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee, mentors and advisors: Prof. Prof. Tega Brain, Prof. Daniel Shiffman and Prof. Luke Dubois for their insightful remarks and encouragement, but also for the constructive feedbacks which inspired me to widen my research from various perspectives.

My sincere thanks also goes to Dr. Elizabeth P. Henaff and Prof. Mark Skwarek. Without their valuable support and guidance, it would not have been possible to conduct this research.

I thank my fellow peer in for the stimulating discussions and user testing for the prototype, and for all the collaboration, learning and fun we have had in the last two years. Also, I would like to thank my friends in the following institution: NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Center For Data Science and Courant Institute of Mathematics. In particular, I am grateful to Prof. Iddo Drori for enlightening me the first glance of the research.

Finally, I would like to thank my family members, especially my parents for supporting me generously throughout writing this thesis coursework and my life in general.
