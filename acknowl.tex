\begin{acknowledgments} 

This work would not have been possible without the help and support of the following people who generously contributed to the work presented in this thesis.

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Gene Kogan for the continuous support of my thesis study and research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my thesis study.

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Prof. Daniel Schiffman, Prof. Alberto Maria Cherici and Prof. Luke Dubois for their insightful comments and encouragement, but also for the hard question which incented me to widen my research from various perspectives.

My sincere thanks also goes to Dr. Elizabeth P. Henaff and Prof. Mark Skwarek. Without their valuable support and guidance, it would not be possible to conduct this research.

I thank my fellow peer in for the stimulating discussions and user testing for the prototype, for the sleepless nights we were working together before deadlines, and for all the fun we have had in the last two years. Also, I thank my friends in the following institution NYU Tandon School of Engineering and Courant Institute of Mathematics. In particular, I am grateful to Dr. Iddo Drori for enlightening me the first glance of research.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family: my parents for supporting me spiritually throughout writing this thesis and my life in general.
