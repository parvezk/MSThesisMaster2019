Feature Visualization Notes========================
There is a growing sense that neural networks need to be interpretable to humans. The field of neural network interpretability has formed in response to these concerns. As it matures, two major threads of research have begun to coalesce: feature visualization and attribution.

Feature visualization answers questions about what a network — or parts of a network — are looking for by generating examples.

Attribution 1 studies what part of an example is responsible for the network activating a particular way.

which help us understand what information a model keeps and what it throws away. 

We are only at the beginning of understanding which objectives are interesting, and there is a lot of room for more work in this area.

Visualizing features with optimization. Optimization also has the advantage of flexibility. This flexibility can also be helpful in visualizing how features evolve as the network trains. 

examine techniques to get diverse visualizations, understand how neurons interact, and avoid high frequency artifacts.

Study techniques for visualizing and understanding neural networks, it's important to be able to try your experiments on multiple models.

Fubon Notes===============================

Machine learning is now deeply embedded in business decisions both routine and high-stakes. Consumers' everyday interactions with businesses and their ability to gain access to critical opportunities depend on the output of machine learned models. These techniques have been embraced in regulated domains such as employment, credit, and insurance precisely because they promise to improve the consistency and quality of decision-making. Yet there is growing recognition that learning models from historical data can end up replicating the human biases they promised to stamp out. Over the past few years, algorithmic fairness has become a watchword for consumer advocates, regulators, policymakers, and businesses alike. Less well understood, however, are the many ways that machine learning figures into the far more quotidian business decisions that do not fall under any regulation, but nevertheless raise concerns with fairness, ranging from marketing and advertising to information retrieval and personalization. In this talk, Solon will offer a survey of the wide range of fairness concerns prompted by businesses' embrace of machine learning.

A fireside chat featuring Dr. Barocas in conversation with NYU Stern Professor Foster Provost, the Director of the Fubon Data Analytics and AI Initiative, will follow. We hope you can join us.
